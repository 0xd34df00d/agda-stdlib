* Where to commit changes:

  AGDA_MAINT = last released Agda maintenance version, e.g. 2.4.2.5
  AGDA_MAINT_NEXT = not yet released next Agda maintenance version, e.g. 2.4.2.6

  A. Your change is independent of Agda

    1. Push your commit in the AGDA_MAINT branch
    2. Merge the AGDA_MAINT branch into the AGDA_MAINT_NEXT branch
    3. Merge the AGDA_MAINT_NEXT branch into the master branch

  B. Your change is due to a change in the AGDA_MAINT_NEXT version of Agda

    1. Push your commit in the AGDA_MAINT_NEXT branch
    2. Merge the AGDA_MAINT_NEXT branch into the master branch

  C. Your change is due to a change in the master version of Agda

    1. Push your commit in the master branch

  This scheme should guarantee that the stdlib master branch always builds
  with the Agda master branch, and the stdlib AGDA_MAINT_NEXT branch
  should always build with the active Agda maint branch.
