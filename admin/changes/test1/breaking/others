Version 1.1 in the library added irrelevance to various places in the library.
Unfortunately this exposed the library to several irrelevance-related bugs.
The decision has therefore been taken to roll-back these additions until
irrelevance is more stable. In particular it has been removed from
`_%_`, `_/_`, `_div_`, `_mod_` in `Data.Nat.DivMod` and from `fromℕ≤`,
`inject≤` in `Data.Fin.Base`.
