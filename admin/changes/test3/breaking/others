The proofs `isPreorder` and `preorder` have been moved from the `Setoid`
record to the module `Relation.Binary.Properties.Setoid`.

The function `normalize` in `Data.Rational.Base` has been reimplemented
in terms of a direct division of the numerator and denominator by their
GCD. Although less elegant than the previous implementation, it's
reduction behaviour is much easier to reason about.
