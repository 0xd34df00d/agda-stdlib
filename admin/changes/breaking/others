Version 1.1 in the library added irrelevance to various places in the library.
Unfortunately this exposed the library to several irrelevance-related bugs.
The decision has therefore been taken to roll-back these additions until
irrelevance is more stable. In particular it has been removed from
`_%_`, `_/_`, `_div_`, `_mod_` in `Data.Nat.DivMod` and from `fromℕ≤`,
`inject≤` in `Data.Fin.Base`.

The proofs `isPreorder` and `preorder` have been moved from the `Setoid`
record to the module `Relation.Binary.Properties.Setoid`.

The function `normalize` in `Data.Rational.Base` has been reimplemented
in terms of a direct division of the numerator and denominator by their
GCD. Although less elegant than the previous implementation, it's
reduction behaviour is much easier to reason about.
