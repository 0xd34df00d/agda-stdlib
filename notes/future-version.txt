* Reflection API

  Agda (TODO version) reflection interface now exposes the name hint
  (as a string) for variables (see Agda release notes). In
  consequence, a new type Abs was added, and the types Clause,
  Pattern, Term and Type were modified in Reflection.agda.

* The fixity of all _∎ and finally operators was changed from infix 2
  to infix 3.
