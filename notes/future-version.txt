* Reflection API

  Agda (TODO version) reflection interface now exposes the name hint
  (as a string) for variables (see Agda release notes). In
  consequence, a new type Abs was added, and the types Clause,
  Pattern, Term and Type were modified in Reflection.agda.

* The fixity of all _∎ and finally operators, as well as
  Category.Monad.Partiality.All._⟨_⟩P, was changed from infix 2 to
  infix 3.

* The fixity of Category.Monad.Partiality._≟-Kind_, Data.AVL._∈?_,
  Data.AVL.IndexedMap._∈?_, Data.AVL.Sets._∈?_, Data.Bool._≟_,
  Data.Char._≟_, Data.Float._≟_, Data.Nat._≤?_,
  Data.Nat.Divisibility._∣?_, Data.Sign._≟_, Data.String._≟_,
  Data.Unit._≟_, Data.Unit._≤?_,
  Data.Vec.Equality.DecidableEquality._≟_ was changed from the default
  to infix 4.

* The fixity of all _≟<something>_ operators in Reflection is now
  infix 4 (some of them already had this fixity).

* The fixity of Algebra.Operations._×′_ was changed from the default
  to infixr 7.

* The fixity of Data.Fin.#_ was changed from the default to infix 10.

* The fixity of Data.Nat.Divisibility.1∣_ and _∣0 was changed from the
  default to infix 10.

* The fixity of Data.Nat.DivMod._divMod_, _div_ and _mod_ was changed
  from the default to infixl 7.

* The fixity of Data.Product.Σ-syntax was changed from the default to
  infix 2.

* The fixity of Relation.Unary._~ was changed from the default to infix
  10.
